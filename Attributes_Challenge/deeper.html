      Draw some coloured lines. Try using different tags for each line.
    </p>
    <!--If a rectangle has no height, it's basically a line. Divs and p without
    content have no height but 100% width. These elements are called block
    elements-->
    <div style = "border-style:solid; border-color:blue; border-width:1px;"></div>
    <hr style = "margin-top:15px; border: 1px solid red;">
    <p style = "border: 1px solid green;"></p>
    <p>
      This is two DIVs overlapping. Notice the borders.
    </p>
    <!--Sometimes, it's easier to put divs inside more divs. This helps redefine
    the absolute position since absolute position is relative to the position of
    the parent element. Bodies by default have an 8px margin hence right:8px.
    The a in rgba stands for alpha which is basically opacity. This way, your
    text opacity isn't affected, but the background colours can mix. If you use
    the opacity property, your text will get fainter too. z-index determines
    what goes in front of what. A larger z-index goes in front of a smaller one-->
    <div style = "height:100px;">
      <div style = "position:absolute; width:60%; height:100px; right:8px; background:rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5); z-index:3; border-style:dashed; border-color:red">DIV 1</div>
      <div style = "position:absolute; width:60%; height:100px; background:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); z-index:2; border-style:solid;">DIV 2</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      This table should be built with 3 columns. HINT: You don't need the style tag!
    </p>
    <!--If you've finished the deeper challenge for markup, you should know how
    to make tables. This one just takes a bit more time to figure out but is
    otherwise not any harder than the markup challenge table.-->
    <table border = "1" style = "width:100%">
      <tr>  <th colspan = "2">2 columns</th>  <th rowspan = "2">2 rows</th>  </tr>
      <tr>  <th>1112</th>  <th>2222</th>  </tr>
      <tr>  <td rowspan = "2">2 rows</td>  <td>AAAA</td>  <td>BBBB</td>  </tr>
      <tr>  <td>CCCC</td>  <td>DDDD</td>  </tr>
      <tr>  <td>EEEE</td>  <td rowspan = "2" colspan = "2">2 columns and 2 rows</td>  </tr>
      <tr>  <td>FFFF</td>  </tr>
      <tr>  <td>GGGG</td>  <td>HHHH</td>  <td>IIII</td>  </tr>
