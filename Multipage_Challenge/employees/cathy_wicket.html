            <h5>Bio</h5>
            <p>
              My name makes sense if you were Elmer Fudd.<br>
              In west Philadelphia born and raised <br>
              On the playground was where I spent most of my days <br>
              Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool <br>
              And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school <br>
              When a couple of guys who were up to no good <br>
              Started making trouble in my neighborhood <br>
              I got in one little fight and my mom got scared <br>
              She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air' <br>

              I begged and pleaded with her day after day <br>
              But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way <br>
              She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. <br>
              I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'. <br>

              First class, yo this is bad <br>
              Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. <br>
              Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? <br>
              Hmmmmm this might be alright. <br>

              But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that <br>
              Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? <br>
              I don't think so <br>
              I'll see when I get there <br>
              I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air <br>

              Well, the plane landed and when I came out <br>
              There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out <br>
              I ain't trying to get arrested yet <br>
              I just got here <br>
              I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared <br>

              I whistled for a cab and when it came near <br>
              The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror <br>
              If anything I could say that this cab was rare <br>
              But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air' <br>

              I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 <br>
              And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later' <br>
              I looked at my kingdom <br>
              I was finally there <br>
              To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
